# About this project

**Boxes**:  change the color of a box when clicked


This is a simple React Js project that I made for learning useEffect and useState and how to pass functions as a props for a component, also how to use the state if multiple child components share state.

### Try it
1. Download the project boxes
2. cd boxes.
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`

after it should open a tab in your browser with the project running.
